	<p>Are we going back to the world we lived before? Definitely the answer would be No. We neither know when the COVID 19 virus will leave this planet nor it is guaranteed yet. <b>The immediate </b>impact of the COVID 19 is visible already. Many jobs went virtual. Organizations are concentrating on digital transformation. <strong>The organizations</strong> started to rely on data driven decision making as it is the question for their survival in this pandemic time today and for projected success in the future.  On one side we can expect tremendous scope for innovation and growth and on the other side we can see a lot of opportunities are closing at the arrival of COVID 19.</p>
